# Welcome to the Shakespearean word Translator
This is a mini-project that converts words from a shakespearean phrase/sentence into regular english using a table of values (in CSV format).

> The program uses the `rich` pip module give a readable output.

## Design
The design is meant to be compact and fast while also keeping it simple. You may notice that searching through the list of shakespearean words is implemented using a linear search algorithm, which is quite simple and time efficient as there isn't that many words.

## Contribution
Feel free to add any words to the CSV file to make this program more accurate! Please create an issue if there is something that doesn't work, or an improvement needs to be made. There are already existing issues that are up, so make sure to give those a look if you plan on forking the repo :smile:
